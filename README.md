# TextMe

This script can send text messages through your Gmail from the command line.


### How to use

Update the `textme.py` with your phone number, carrier, and email. Find your Gmail app password in the Gmail security settings.

#### Running the batch script
You will need to change the locations of the python.exe and your saved script location to where they are on your computer.

Running `run_script.bat` will allow you to send text messages to yourself from the command line.
